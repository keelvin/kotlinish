- 🎯 **Scope Functions** - `let`, `apply`, `run`, `also`, `with` for fluent code
- 📚 **Powerful Collections** - Safe accessors, advanced operators, immutable by default
- ⚡ **Elegant Async** - Kotlin Coroutines-style concurrency for Dart Isolates
- 🔧 **Developer Experience** - Intuitive APIs that feel natural
- 🎨 **Flutter Ready** - Seamless integration with Flutter widgets and state
